									<h1>Here's me</h1>
									<p>I'm thrilled to have you stop by my portfolio. Allow me to introduce myselfâ€”I'm Bakr, a passionate and driven software engineering student in my early twenties. Currently, I'm pursuing my studies at Bahcesehir university, specializing in the exciting and ever-evolving field of software engineering.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/fotis-fotopoulos-LJ9KY8pIH3E-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>When I'm not immersed in the world of software development, you can find me pursuing my other passions. I have a deep love for fitness, and you'll often find me hitting the gym or engaging in various workouts to stay active and healthy. Staying physically fit not only energizes me but also helps me maintain a focused mindset, which translates well into my coding endeavors.</p>

									<p>Apart from my dedication to coding and fitness, I have an insatiable love for video games. As a gamer, I appreciate the art of storytelling, complex game mechanics, and the joy of immersing myself in virtual worlds. I believe that gaming has not only enhanced my problem-solving skills but also fueled my curiosity to explore new technologies and innovations.</p>
									
								<p>When it comes to sports, football (or soccer, for my American friends) is my go-to choice. Playing football not only allows me to stay active and competitive but also teaches me the value of teamwork, strategic thinking, and resilience. Being on the field is not just about scoring goals; it's about camaraderie, communication, and the pursuit of excellence.</p>
									
							<p>In the world of software engineering, I strive to leverage my technical skills and creativity to build innovative solutions that make a positive impact on people's lives. I enjoy tackling complex problems, breaking them down into manageable pieces, and coming up with elegant and efficient solutions. Whether it's developing software applications, exploring emerging technologies, or collaborating with like-minded individuals, I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to grow and learn.</p>
									
						<p>I believe that the combination of my coding expertise, dedication to fitness, passion for gaming, and love for football brings a unique perspective to my work as a software engineer. I'm excited to embark on this journey, expand my knowledge, and make a lasting contribution to the tech industry.</p>
									
					<p>Feel free to explore my portfolio to get a glimpse of my projects and accomplishments. Let's connect and collaborate on exciting endeavors that push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of software engineering!</p>
